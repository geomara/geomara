🏥 **University of Virginia**  
🎓 **Planned to graduate residency in 2028**

## About Me
I am a neurosurgery resident at the University of Virginia, originally from Greece. I graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki School of Medicine. I have a keen interest in brain imaging and the application of generative models to predict tumor growth. My focus is particularly on skull base tumors such as vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas. I believe that leveraging advanced technologies can help neurosurgeons make better-informed decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Coding Journey
I learned to code in Python during residency and have been exploring its applications in medical imaging. My current projects involve using generative artificial intelligence to make growth predictions in brain tumors. These models could potentially help us identify tumors at risk for growth, allowing for earlier and safer surgical interventions.

## Projects
- **Brain Tumor Growth Prediction**: Using diffusion models to predict the growth of skull base tumors.
- **Python for Medical Imaging**: Exploring various Python libraries and tools for processing and analyzing medical images.
